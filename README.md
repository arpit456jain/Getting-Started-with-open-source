![Hacktoberfest](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59393136/135566614-5635902f-2907-4e01-8baf-3cb1b43a6b20.png)

### What is Git and Github?<br>
Git helps is maintaining the history of the project. It maintains a record of what changes were made to a project , when and by whom.
<br>Github is an online platform that hosts git repository.(Repository is a folder which saves all changes).<br><br>

## What is HacktoberFest?

**`Hacktoberfest`** is an `open-source competition` open to everyone in our global community. Whether you‚Äôre a developer, student learning to code, event host, or company of any size, you can help drive growth of open source and make positive contributions to an ever-growing community. All backgrounds and skill levels are encouraged to complete the challenge.

1. **`Hacktoberfest`** is a celebration open to everyone in our global community.
2. `Pull requests` can be made in any `GitHub-hosted` repositories/projects.
3. You can sign up anytime between `October 1` and `October 31`.

## Rules:

To earn your **`Hacktoberfest T-Shirt`** or tree reward, you must register and make four valid pull requests (PRs) between `October 1-31` (in any time zone). PRs can **NOT** be made to any public repo on GitHub, maintainers have to opt in with the topic **`Hacktoberfest`** on the repo. If a `maintainer` reports your pull request as `spam` or behavior not in line with the project‚Äôs code of conduct, you will be `ineligible` to participate. This year, the first **`70,000`** participants who successfully complete the challenge will be eligible to receive a `prize`.

## Projects in which you can contribute:

-   Any `github` repository with the **`Hacktoberfest`** topic
-   For the sake of convenience, you can contribute to this very project :)

### 1. The first thing you need is Git installed on your system, if it is not installed then download it as per your OS and install it.

<h3>Git Setup :- </h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads">Download Git</a> as per your OS.</li>
<li>Git installation<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2j7fD92g-gE"> Video</a> for Windows User</li>
<li>Git installation<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZM3I16Z-lxI"> Video</a> for Mac User</li>

<li>Install Git</li>
<li>Open the Git Bash ( Right Click )</li>
<li>Run the Commands</li>

`$ git config --global user.name "Your Name"`

`$ git config --global user.email youremail@example.com`

`$ git config --list`

<li>You should be able to see your entered name and email under <mark>user.name</mark> & <mark>user.email</mark></li>

</ul><br>
<hr>

### 2. You should have an account on GitHub if you you don't have an account then simply make it.

### 3. You will need a text editor accoring to your comfort , I prefer Vs code

-   <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/download">Download Vs Code</a> as per your OS.
-   Vs Code installation<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlIzFUI1QGA"> Video</a> as per your OS.

#### Other Text Editors

-   <a href="https://brackets.io/">Brackets</a>
-   <a href="https://www.codeblocks.org/">Code Block</a>

### 4. Now you just have to setup the project from GitHub to your local system.

<h3>Setting Project on your Local System :- </h3><br>
<ul>
<li>Fork this Repository or Project</li>
 <li> This will create a copy of this repository in your account.</li>
<img width="50%" align="center" src="images/fork.png"><br><br>
<li>Copy the link of the Repository</li><br>
<img width="50%" align="center"  src="images/clone.png"><br><br>
<li>Open Git bash where you want to clone the project and clone it </li>
 <li>Clone it</li>
<li>Run Command and Hit Enter <br>
 
 ```
 git clone <the link you just copied>
 ```
 <img width="70%" align="center"  src="images/gitclone.png"><br><br>
 
 In this case it is <br> ``` git clone  https://github.com/arpit456jain/Getting-Started-with-open-source.git ```
  </li>
 <li> After you hit enter you will notice that some downloading will start. It's actually cloning of repo form your GitHub repository to your local system.</li><br>
 <img width="60%" align="center"  src="images/clonning.png">
 <li> After this you will notice a folder is created with the name of repository </li><br>
 <img width="15%" align="center"  src="images/folder.png"><br><br>
 <li>Then just close the Git bash and open this folder in your preferred text editor...</li><br>
 <li>Here is an example in VS Code. </li><br>
 <img width="100%" align="center"  src="images/vscode.png"><br><br>
</ul>

### 5. Now Make necessary changes and commit them , lets say you have to add your name in readme , you already set up the project in local system . Now before starting your work always rembember to pull latest change from the main Repo.

<ul>

 <li>Fetch And Merge </li><br>
 <img width="50%" align="center"  src="images/fetch.png"><br>
	<br>
 <li>Pull these changes in your local system</li>
 	<br>
 ```
 git pull origin master
 ```
	<br><br>
 The same command can also be divided into the following - <br>
	1. Fetching all commits from upstream <br>
	git fetch --all --prune<br>
	2. Reset the main branch of origin to upstream<br>
	git reset --hard upstream/main<br><br>
	
 <img width="50%" align="center"  src="images/pullorigin.png"><br><br>
 
 <li> make a new branch and then make the changes , then commit them. make sure to commit to the new branch <br>
 <b>Never commit in master branch</b> </li>
 
 ```
 git checkout -b new_branch_name
 git add -A
 git commit -a -m "message"
 ```
 <li>After commiting your changes on your local host you have to push that changes to GitHub , make sure you push the new branch </li>
 
 ```
git push origin new_branch_name
 ```

</ul>
  
### 6. Make the Pull Request
<ul>
<li>when you push the changes you will notice a new branch will be created on GitHub and there will be a green button for creating pull request. Click on it.</li>
<br>
<img width="80%" align="center"  src="images/createPR.png"><br><br> 
<li>After this a new page will be open like this</li>
<img width="80%" align="center"  src="images/PR.png"><br><br>
<li>Now add a title and description of your PR and click on create pull request.</li>
<br>
<li>Congrats üéâ your Pull Request is created</li><br>
<img width="80%" align="center"  src="images/PRcreated.png"><br><br>
</ul>

# Some Common Error And Their Solutions

### 1. Updates were rejected or failed to push some refs.

<img width="80%" align="center"  src="images/error1.png"><br>

<p> This is most common error you will find and its pretty easy to solve . </p>
<br>
<p><b>Solution:</b> You just have to pull latest changes to your local system first and then you can push them </p>

```
git pull origin master
```

<p>
Note : if your repo is a forked one and its some commit behind then first fetch n merge then pull changes

</p>

### 2. Unable to detect identity.

<img width="80%" align="center"  src="images/Error2.png"><br>

<p> Its pretty easy to solve . </p>
<br>
<p><b>Solution:</b> You just have to write your username and email </p>

```
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
```

```
git config --global user.email youremail@example.com
```

### 3. Remote origin already exists.

<img width="80%" align="center" src="images/Error3.png"><br>

<p>It is easy to solve<p>
<br>
<p><b>Solution:</b> You just have to update the URL of the remote repository with the name "origin" to the URL of the remote repository you want to add</p>

```
git remote set-url origin <repository url>
```

### 3. Refusing to merge unrelated histories.

<img width="80%" align="center" src="images/Error4.png"><br>

<p>This error appears when some of your ambiguous actions confuse Git on how to function further.<p>
<br>
<p><b>Solution:</b> The solution to this fatal error is to use ‚Äìallow-unrelated-histories flag with the git pull command or git merge command.</p>

```
git pull origin master ‚Äìallow-unrelated-histories
```

### 3. OpenSSL SSL_read: Connection was reset.

<img width="80%" align="center" src="images/Error5.png"><br>

<p>This is the SSL certificate of the server that has not been signed by a third party, so an error is reported.<p>
<br>
<p><b>Solution:</b> This error is most likely caused by network instability and connection timeout.</p>

```
git config http.sslVerify "false"
```
<br><br>
### 4. It is always best to make a new branch.
<br><br>
NEVER commit on the main branch.<br><br>
The importance of adding a new branch is that we can work on the code until our changes are finalized. Suppose you are working on a project that needs x changes. It will be easier for the maintainer to review changes one at a time instead of all the changes in a single PR. The maintainer can easily suggest changes in your PR on a particular issue.<br><br>
After finalizing and completing the code, the branch can be merged with the main branch. <br>
1 branch can only have one PR. <br><br>
<p>

# Common Git Commands you should know!!!

### 1. Git checkout

<li>You can use the checkout command to switch the branch that you are currently working on. </li>
 
 ```
git checkout <branch name>
 ```
<li>You can use the checkout command with `-b` to create a new branch and switch to the same. </li>
 
 ```
git checkout -b <branch name>
 ```

### 2. Git init

<li>This is the command you need to use if you want to start a new empty repository or to reinitialize an existing one in the project root. It will create a .git directory with its subdirectories. </li>
 
 ```
git init <repository name>
 ```

### 3. Git diff

<li>You can use this command to see the unstaged changes on the current branch. </li>
 
 ```
git diff
 ```

<li>If you want to see the staged changes. </li>
 
 ```
git diff --staged
 ```

<li>Or you can compare two branches: </li>
 
 ```
gif diff <branch1> <branch2>
 ```

### 4. Git add

<li>This is the command you need to use to stage changed files. You can stage individual files. </li>
 
 ```
git add <file path>
 ```

<li>You can also stage all files. </li>
 
 ```
git add .
 ```

### 5. Git branch

<li>Using git branch will list all the branches of the repository. </li>
 
 ```
git branch
 ```

<li>Or you can use it to create a new branch, without checking it out. </li>
 
 ```
git branch <new branch>
 ```

<li>To delete a branch. </li>
 
 ```
git branch -d <branch name>
 ```

### 6. Git log

<li>If you want to see what you have committed till now. </li>
 
 ```
git log
 ```

<li>If you want to see last 5 commits among 100000 commits. </li>
 
 ```
git log -p -1
 ```

### 7. Git merge

<li>Merge the changes made in a staging branch into the stable branch. </li>
 
 ```
git merge <branch_name>
 ```

### 8. Git rm

 <p>Remove files or directories from the working index (staging area). With git rm, there are two options to keep in mind: force and cached. Running the command with force deletes the file. The cached command removes the file from the working index. When removing an entire directory, a recursive command is necessary.</p>

<li>To remove a file from the working index (cached) </li>
 
 ```
git rm --cached <file name>
 ```

<li>To delete a file (force) </li>
 
 ```
git rm -f <file name>
 ```

<li>To remove an entire directory from the working index (cached) </li>
 
 ```
git rm -r --cached <directory name>
 ```

<li>To delete an entire directory (force) </li>
 
 ```
git rm -r -f <file name>
 ```

### 9. Git stash

 <p>To save changes made when they‚Äôre not in a state to commit them to a repository. This will store the work and give a clean working directory. For instance, when working on a new feature that‚Äôs not complete, but an urgent bug needs attention. </p>

<li>Store current work with untracked files </li>
 
 ```
git stash -u
 ```

<li>Bring stashed work back to the working directory </li>
 
 ```
git stash pop
 ```
 
 ### 10. Git clear

<li>To clean git bash. </li>
 
 ```
git clear
 ```

## <ins> What if I have Merge Conflicts? </ins>

#### A GitHub conflict is when people make changes to the same area or line in a file. This must be fixed before it is merged in order to prevent collision in the main branch.

-   #### To read more about this, go to [Github Docs - About Merge Conflicts](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/addressing-merge-conflicts/about-merge-conflicts)
-   #### To find out about how to fix a Git Conflict, go to [Github Docs - Resolve Merge Conflict](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/addressing-merge-conflicts/resolving-a-merge-conflict-on-github)

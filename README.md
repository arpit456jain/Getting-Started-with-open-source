# 1. The first thing you need is Git installed on your system, if it is not installed then download it as per your OS and install it.
<h2>Git Setup :- </h2>
<ul>
<li><h3><a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads">Download Git</a> as per your OS. </h3></li>
<li><h3>Git installation<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2j7fD92g-gE">Video</a> as per your OS.  </h3></li>
<li><h3>Install Git</h3></li>
<li><h3>Open the Git Bash ( Right Click )</h3></li>
<li><h3>Run the Commands</h3></li>

`$ git config --global user.name "Your Name"`

`$ git config --global user.email youremail@example.com`

`$ git config --list`

<li><h3>You Should see your entered name and email under `user.name` & `user.email`</h3></li>

</ul><br>

# 2. You should have an account on GitHub if you you dont't have an account then simply make it.
# 3. You will need a text editor accoring to your comfort , I prefer Vs code 
- <h3><a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/download">Download Vs Code</a> as per your OS. </h3>
- <h3>Vs Code installation<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlIzFUI1QGA">Video</a> as per your OS.  </h3>
- <h3> Install it </h3>

# 4. Now you just have to setup the project from GitHub to your local system.
<h2>Setting Project on Local System :- </h2><br>
<ul>
<li><h3>Fork this Repository or Project</h3></li>
 <li> <p>This will create a copy of this repository in your account.</p></li>
<img width="50%" align="center" src="fork.png"><br><br>
<li><h3>Copy the link of the Repository </h3></li><br>
<img width="50%" align="center"  src="clone.png"><br><br>
<li><h3>Open Git bash where you want to clone the project and clone it </h3></li>
 <li> <h3>Clone it</h3></li>
<li>Run Command and Hit Enter <br>
 
 ```
 git clone <the link you just copied>
 ```
 <img width="70%" align="center"  src="gitclone.png"><br><br>
 
 In this case it is
 ``` git clone  https://github.com/arpit456jain/Getting-Started-with-open-source.git ```
  </li>
 <li> After you hit enter you will notice that some downloading will start. It's actually cloning of repo form your GitHub to your local system.</li><br>
 <img width="60%" align="center"  src="clonning.png">
 <li> After this you will notice a folder is created with the name of repository </li><br>
 <img width="10%" align="center"  src="folder.png"><br><br>
 <li>Then just close the Git bash and open this folder and open VS code here</li><br>
 <img width="100%" align="center"  src="vscode.png"><br><br>
</ul>

# 5. Now Make necessary changes and commit them , let say you have to add your name in read me , you already set up the project in local system . Now before starting your work always rembember to pull latest change from the main Repo.
<ul>
 <li>Fetch And Merge </li><br>
 <img width="50%" align="center"  src="fetch.png"><br>
 <li>Pull these changes in your local system</li>
 
 ```
 git pull origin master
 ```
 
 <img width="50%" align="center"  src="pullorigin.png"><br><br>
 
 <li> make a new branch and made the changes , then commit them. make sure to commit to the new branch <b>never commit in master branch<b> </li>
 
 ```
 git checkout -b new_branch_name
 git add -A
 git commit -a -m "message"
 ```
 <li>After commiting your chnanges on your local host you have to push that changes to GitHub , make sure you push the new branch </li>
 
 ```
git push origin new_branch_name
 ```

</ul>
  
# 6. Make the Pull Request
<ul>
<li>when you push the changes you will notice a new branch will be created on GtiHub and there will be a green button for creating pull request. Click on it.</li>
<img width="50%" align="center"  src="createPR.png"><br><br>

## <ins> What if I have a Conflict? </ins>

#### A GitHub conflict is when people make changes to the same area or line in a file. This must be fixed before it is merged in order to prevent collision in the main branch.

- #### To read more about this, go to [Github Docs - About Merge Conflicts](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/addressing-merge-conflicts/about-merge-conflicts)
- #### To find out about how to fix a Git Conflict, go to [Github Docs - Resolve Merge Conflict](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/addressing-merge-conflicts/resolving-a-merge-conflict-on-github)

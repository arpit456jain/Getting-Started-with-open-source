# 1. The first thing you need is Git installed on your system, if it is not installed then download it as per your OS and install it.
<h2>Git Setup :- </h2>
<ul>
<li><h3><a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads">Download Git</a> as per your OS. </h3></li>

<li>Run Command and Hit Enter <br>
 
 ```
 git clone <the link you just copied>
 ```

 In this case it is
 ``` git clone  https://github.com/arpit456jain/Getting-Started-with-open-source.git ```
  </li>
 <li> After you hit enter you will notice that some downloading will start. It's actually cloning of repo form your GitHub to your local system.</li><br>
 <img width="60%" align="center"  src="clonning.png">
 <li> After this you will notice a folder is created with the name of repository </li><br>
 <img width="10%" align="center"  src="folder.png"><br><br>
 <li>Then just close the Git bash and open this folder and open VS code here</li><br>
 <img width="100%" align="center"  src="vscode.png"><br><br>
</ul>

# 5. Now Make necessary changes and commit them , let say you have to add your name in read me , you already set up the project in local system . Now before starting your work always rembember to pull latest change from the main Repo.
<ul>
 <li>Fetch And Merge </li><br>

 ```
 git checkout -b new_branch_name
 git add -A
 git commit -a -m "message"
 ```
 <li>After commiting your chnanges on your local host you have to push that changes to GitHub , make sure you push the new branch </li>
 
 ```

 ```

</ul>
  
# 6. Make the Pull Request

## <ins> What if I have a Conflict? </ins>

#### A GitHub conflict is when people make changes to the same area or line in a file. This must be fixed before it is merged in order to prevent collision in the main branch.

- #### To read more about this, go to [Github Docs - About Merge Conflicts](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/addressing-merge-conflicts/about-merge-conflicts)
- #### To find out about how to fix a Git Conflict, go to [Github Docs - Resolve Merge Conflict](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/addressing-merge-conflicts/resolving-a-merge-conflict-on-github)
